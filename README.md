# OmicsBatchCorrect
## Introduction
The technology advancement of mass spectrometry-based proteomics and metabolomics have enabled large-scale studies, where hundreds to thousands of samples are analyzed in batches across multiple instruments and/or across time. Therefore, technical variations or non-biological variations are introduced as batch effect. Herein we established a streamlined web-based pipeline `Omics Batch Correct (OBC)` to evaluate, visualize, and correct the batch effect in a one-stop manner with proteomics or metabolomics data as input. It was demonstrated to enable sensitive and accurate the batch-effect correction using clinical proteomics and metabolomics studies.OBC was available at https://omia.untangledbio.com/OmicsBatchCorrect/ for free.
